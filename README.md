<h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello!
My name is Charlton, and as of now, I am a high school student with a deep passion for creating and exploring new ideas.

I'm currently building these pages, games, and experiments mainly for fun and to support some of my school projects.
What started as simple curiosity has grown into a powerful journey of discovery and innovation.

<h1>🚀 Interests</h1>

I'm deeply interested in the following fields:

    Programming — Crafting intelligent systems and solving real-world problems through code.

    Electronics — Building circuits, experimenting with microcontrollers, and bridging hardware and software.

    Game and App Development — Designing interactive experiences and creative digital solutions.

<h1>🎯 Why I Create</h1>

I love making apps, games, and projects because it challenges my mind.
Each project pushes me to think more

<h1>📚 Currently Learning</h1>

I'm actively expanding my knowledge and skills in:

    Advanced C++ and Python Programming

    AI & Machine Learning Fundamentals

    Embedded Systems and IoT

    Game Development with Unity and Godot

    App Development (Web and Desktop, including Electron and Qt)

    UI/UX Design for better user experiences

Every day is a new opportunity to learn something that will build the future.
🛠 Tools and Technologies

Here are some of the main tools, libraries, and platforms I work with:

<h1>🏆 Achievements So Far</h1>

✅ Built a dynamic School Report Generator using JavaScript and PDF generation.
✅ Designed physics simulation experiments for learning projectile motion and kinematics.
✅ Prototyped custom siren systems using Arduino and Raspberry Pi (integrated with AI!).
✅ Created interactive games and webpages with responsive design and animation.

    Small wins, building into massive success.

<h2>📈 Goals for This Year</h2>

    🎯 Launch a full-scale web app or mobile app.

    🎯 Complete an AI project that uses camera-based object detection.

    🎯 Learn and build using 3D Engines (like Godot or Unity 3D).

    🎯 Master full-stack app development.

<h1>🌌 Final Words</h1>

I am driven by curiosity, creativity, and courage.
No idea is too small. No dream is too big.
As long as you build every day — you are unstoppable.

Thanks for visiting — and remember:

    "The future belongs to those who build it."
